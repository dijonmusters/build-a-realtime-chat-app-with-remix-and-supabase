## üîç About

[Supabase](http://supabase.com?utm_source=egghead&utm_campaign=remix) is a collection of open-source tools that wrap around a PostgreSQL database. In this course, we look at building a realtime chat application with Remix, using Supabase for db hosting, authentication, authorization and subscribe to realtime db events - updating the UI as the database changes.

We will learn about:

- loaders and actions in Remix
- querying and mutating data with Supabase
- authentication with GitHub
- authorization with RLS
- merging client and server state with realtime events
- deploying a Remix app to Vercel

This course is 100% TypeScript, however, don't stress if you don't have any experience with TS, as Supabase does most of the heavy lifting here! üéâ

Check out the [Extensions section](./11-deploy-remix-app-to-vercel/README.md) for ideas of how you can continue your learning journey after this course.
